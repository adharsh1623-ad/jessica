Women are involved in all parts of society, but some matters affect and touch women more than others. 
•	women in conflict areas are increasingly turning to technology to build peace and reduce gender inequality.
•	Objective of our project is to  provide safety to women from sexual abuse ,theft and  crime by use of Information technology. The project idea is to have a software/Information technology layer between all the people and police department.It will also help in emergency situations like if on fire.

•	   Speech Recognition pathway is implemented here for the software.The goal of the speech recognition is to generate methodologies and technologies that enable the recognition and also the translation of spoken language into text.Speech recognition is related to concept of speech to text,the device recognises your words and  writes them down in the form of text.Most technologists work on text rather than Voices.
 
•	A speech recognition algorithm or voice recognition algorithm is used in speech recognition technology to convert voice to text.
Speech recognition systems have several advantages:
•	Helps hearing and visually impaired people.
•	Handsfree communication: Smartphone assistants such as Apple’s Siri and Google Assistant have made it possible to use voice to make calls, send emails, search, and more without touching the phone.
•	Controlling Digital Devices: Digital personal assistants like Alexa and Google Home obviously require verbal communication between humans and computers. They are also great examples of how computers use machine learning to better understand your speech over time through experience. But in order to do so, speech recognition technology, enabled by signal processing, is key.
•	It all starts with human sound in a normal environment. Technically, this environment is referred to as an analog environment. A computer can’t work with analog data; it needs digital data. This is why the first piece of equipment needed is an analog to digital converter.
•	Speech recognition incorporates different fields of research in computer science, linguistics and computer engineering. Many modern devices or text-focused programs may have speech recognition functions in them to allow for easier or hands-free use of a device.
How it works
Speech recognition works using algorithms through acoustic and language modeling. Acoustic modeling represents the relationship between linguistic units of speech and audio signals; language modeling matches sounds with word sequences to help distinguish between words that sound similar.

•	Our software made python language using machine learning algorithm using IBM’s Watson speech to text.
•	When we say” help me” and our algorithm, send your location to the police department through SMS service by the usage of API(application programing interface) key  example : twilio , Fast2sms.
•	API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface, which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. Each time you use an app like Facebook, send an instant message, or check the weather on your phone, you're using an API.To simplify, an API delivers a user response to a system and sends the system’s response back to a user. You click “add to cart;” an API tells the site you added a product to your cart; the website puts the product in your cart, and your cart is updated.
•	You may hear the term “microservices” come up in relation to API. These however, are not the same. Microservices are a style or architecture which divides functionality within a web application. While API is the framework which developers interact with a web application. Microservices can actually use API to communicate between each other. API lets a developer make a specific “call” or “request” in order to send or receive information. 
•	Twilio's API is used here.Twilio’s APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) power its platform for communications. Behind these APIs is a software layer connecting and optimizing communications networks around the world to allow your users to call and message anyone, globally.Twilio has a whole host of APIs, from SMS to Voice to Wireless!

•Twilio  API has a advantage of used by python,because it   is a python request library.
•Fast2sms is another  API used here.We will be using Fast2SMS API to send messages. You don’t need to install any Python package for this purpose. Fast2sms is used to send text messages using Python. We will be using Fast2SMS API to send messages.
•	  Whatever we are speak,we are releasing some frequencies and those frequencies are getting absorbed by the microphone which is installed on your phone and that microphone absorbs that frequencies and converts your voice into digital format and after that the digital input is getting passed into Machine Learning Algorithm and Machine Learning Algorithm tries to understand that what exactly the user is trying to say using Text Analysis.
•	This software shall be very helpful to the people, especially the women in trouble because it reaches the Nearby Police stations within seconds.And the device uses Artificial intelligence also for effective Speech Recognition.
