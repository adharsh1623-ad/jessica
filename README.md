<i><h4>This is The Code About The Speech Recogntion Software That Is Made  Up of Python. This Code Use IBM Watson Speech-To-Text To recognize The Speech Commands .
If The Person Say "Help Me " in Voice data ,The Code Will Send A Message To the Police Department OR For  Any number He/She Assigned To the Speech Model
A speech recognition algorithm or voice recognition algorithm is used in speech recognition technology to convert voice to text.</h4><i>

        <h4 align= "left">whats the problem?</h4>
        Women are involved in all parts of society, but some matters they have been harashed  to , in order to provide safety to women from sexual abuse ,theft and  crime by .
         <h4 align= "left">how technolgy can help?</h4>
          Speech Recognition  is implemented here for the software by using the speech rcogntion module in python.The goal of the speech recognition is to gather the voice_data and reply according to it . The technnolgy Twilio ,fastsms,IBM watson.
        <h4 align= "left">The Idea</h4>
         To Protect Women and Public by using Twilio messaging system ,Fast2sms by IBM watson Speech to text python algorithm.The python code  get the input and transfer the SOS message to Police department or any number you have used .

* Watson Speech to Text processes the audio and extracts the text.
* Watson Translation (optionally) can translate the text to the desired language.
* The app stores the translated text as a document within Object Storage.
